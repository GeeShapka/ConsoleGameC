add a collision map file for each map.
	import from the collision map for the collision tracker so i can support collision for any characters on
	the main map by using only one character type on the Collision map.
add a splash screen
add key to press to display controls
add an exit screen
add npc detection
	make it directionless, so you only need to be on an adjacent tile
	button press to interact (e)?
